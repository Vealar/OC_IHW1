A soap opera is a long, often melodramatic piece of fiction that tends to focus on family relationships and various domestic1 situations. Usually it has no clear protagonist (or there are few of them, equally important to the plot), and is presented in the form of a serial. The term itself was coined2 way back in the 1950s, when such radio dramas were often interrupted by soap commercials. The soap operas were usually broadcasted in the middle of the day. The target audience of the genre would be middle-aged stay-at-home moms3 who needed some sort of spice in their life to make their daily chores4 more bearable.
The series that are widely considered to be the first soap opera ever made were Painted Dreams. This radio show started in 1930 and was broadcasted up to 1942. The plot revolved around the relationships between a widowed single mother and her teenage daughter.
The world’s longest-running soap opera of our time is The Archers: starting in 1951, it’s still well alive nowadays, and boasts5 more than 19,000 episodes as of July 2020. Set as ‘a contemporary drama in a rural6 setting’, this radio drama has won its lead actor Norman Painting a Guinness World Record Award as the longest-serving actor in a single soap opera.
The longest TV soap operas are American Guiding Light and British Coronation Street, both starting around 1960 (although Guiding Light was also on radio for good 20 years before that!). Guiding Light aired its last episode in 2009, while Coronation Street celebrated its 10,000th episode on February 7th, 2020.
If you prefer counting the longest by an episode count, the top five would be all American shows: Guiding Light (15,762 episodes in total, both TV and radio), General Hospital (14,557 episodes), Days of Our Lives (13,902 episodes), As the World Turns (13,858 episodes) and The Young and the Restless (11,745 episodes). To put it in perspective, the notorious Santa-Barbara ended at 2,137th episode, while Dynasty ended at 220th, and Charmed had only 178 episodes in total.
In the 21st century the soap genre has seen a revival with some of the famous series making a moderately successful reboot7 comebacks, and with other series borrowing some of the more distinct soap opera traits for their own use.
